    <h1 id="wclutility">WCLUtility</h1>
<p>A utility to help with the <a href="https://battlefy.com/world-of-tanks-community-league-wcl">WCL</a> - World of Tanks Communit League</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>It's a small console application, running over .Net 4.7.1, that receives a master file, from <a href="https://battlefy.com/">Battlefy</a>, containing the teams (clans), it's players, contact information etc and (try) to validade this data to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clan's tags are correct;</li>
<li>Player's Gamers Tags are correct;</li>
<li>Contact's Gamer Tag is correct;</li>
<li>Contact's e-mail os correct;</li>
<li>Preferred and Backup Game Server are valid choices;</li>
<li>The parent clan, if any, is correct;</li>
<li>That players on the team that were on the top 32 teams of the previous season are correctly reported.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<p>The program parses the CSV, and then for each peace of information it queries some <a href="https://developers.wargaming.net/">WG APIs</a> and apply some heuristics to <em>clean up</em> the data.</p>
<p>The output of the program is another CSV, with the data validated, and aditional columns with normalized information, or the reason why the original record is wrong.</p>
<h3 id="er.i-mean-how-to-run-the-program">Er... I mean <em>how to run</em> the program!</h3>
<p>If you already have the binaries provided by me, just go to the directory where you copied this and click on the program <code>WCLUtilityGui.exe</code> (the one with the tank icon), and follow the
instructions.</p>
<p>The program may take several minutes to run, as it needs to query <em>a lot</em> of data over the Internet. So, be patient.</p>
<p>After the program runs it outputs 3 files, on the same directory that the original was:</p>
<ul>
<li>One with <code>valid.</code> before the original file name, containing general information about a player;</li>
<li>One with <code>tanks.</code> before the original file name, containg details on every tier X tank that each player has ever played;</li>
<li>One with <code>clans.</code> before the original file name, containg a summary of every team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>If you want to compile, just clone and open on Visual Studio (I used VS 2017, But the free edition will do it). You will be missing a small text file called <code>AppId.txt</code>. It contains the <em>Wargaming App Id</em> that you can create on their <a href="https://developers.wargaming.net/">Developer Portal</a>.</p>
<p>Without this key file on the same directory of the binaries the application will run with the <code>demo</code> app id, witch is quite limited, or may not even work at all.</p>
<h2 id="wcl3-fields">WCL3 Fields</h2>
<h3 id="full-file">Full File</h3>
<ul>
<li>Team Name;</li>
<li>Gamer Tag (inGameName);</li>
<li>CheckInAt (?)</li>
<li>Team Name (Again!?);</li>
<li>Clan Tag;</li>
<li>Clan Membership Page Link;</li>
<li>Preferred Server;</li>
<li>Alternate Server;</li>
<li>Team Contact E-Mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>or the program can proccess a simple file, as bellow.</p>
<h3 id="simple-file">Simple File</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gamer Tag (inGameName);</li>
<li>Team Name;</li>
<li>Clan Tag.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="path-ahead">Path Ahead</h2>
<ul>
<li><del>Computing WN8, WinRate and Average Tier of the Players and Teams;</del></li>
<li><del>Exporting information on the tier X tanks;</del></li>

</ul>
